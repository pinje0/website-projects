### Description

I hosting my website using replit for my first website, because obviously its free

And of course , i dont use framework on this one, thats why the structure a little bit disorganized / messed up because i got confused a lot by the class, and in the style.css i dont even dare to organize it because i scare to mess things up.
But as long its working, i guess its alright lol

i just use html-css for this one, because i cant use javascript (yet)
