### Description

In this website i tried using css-framework (bootstrap) for the first time. Its kinda 'easy' using framework instead styling with css one-by-one , and its just copy-paste
so its more like all i need to do is read the docs for the template

And im trying to make it responsive on the other device as well. 

So yeah, still not using javascript ,and im working on it
